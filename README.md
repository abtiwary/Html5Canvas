Various experiments with HTML5 Canvas when I first started to learn about it. 
- html5pnm.html : uses the FileReader API to parse a NetPBM file dragged and dropped by the user and then display it to a canvas 
- canvasmanip5.html : manipulate image data for an image loaded into an HTML5 Canvas 
- canvashisto.html : given image data from an image loaded into an HTML5 Canvas, generate a histogram for a channel and plot it using Flot
